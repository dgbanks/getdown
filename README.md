## getdown

Getdown is a fully-functional Meetup clone which allows account holders to
find groups and events nearby organized by other users who are looking to
get down with people who share their interests and hobbies.

#### Features

Getdown uses a Ruby on Rails backend, a JavaScript/React frontend, and
is deployed through Heroku.

###### Groups

Groups can be accessed in multiple ways on Getdown. They can be found
through searching by name, description, or location on the homepage.
Users can also find groups they've already joined by visiting the
'Your Groups' tab in the dropdown menu, or through the links provided
with each event in the 'Upcoming' index on the bottom half of the page.

Group detail pages include buttons which allow users to join or add a
new event for that group, as well as a navigation menu on the left side
with the group's most basic information and an index, ordered by date,
of that group's upcoming events in the main content section.

###### Events

A logged-in user can see his or her events
